About Us

Lose To Gain is the Bangladesh's largest online fitness and nutrition community. Lose to Gain started its journey as a small Facebook group that used to teach people about nutrition and help them get fit.

 Lose To Gain was founded in March 2017 by Sajedur Rahman, while he was studying Fitness Nutrition at International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA).
