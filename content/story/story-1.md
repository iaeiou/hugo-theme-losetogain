Alhamdulillah could reach my goal with my dedication and Sajed vaiâ€™s mentorship. He was patient throughout the whole time period! Though when I finished my 24 week programme I was 64 then I lost that remaining 4 kg slowly!! Still diet and workout kori sustho thakar jonno.

All I can say I feel light, a few of my health issues already vanished because of losing weight. Changed my food lifestyle! Low carb is love thank you so much Vaiya!! Aber jodi future e motu hoye jai aber apnake Knock korbo but I will try to maintain this lifestyle.
