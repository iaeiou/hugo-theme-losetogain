From my childhood I was fatty. In my professional life I have to spend my day sitting & was not able to lose weight. Before some months I heard from my colleague Mahmuda Diba about Lose 2 Gain & joined. I observed group activities & decided to transform myself with the help of this group.

Then I decided to take 12 weeks mentorship program as I thought it wouldn't be wise to prepare myself the diet chart without having proper knowledge about nutrition. I made a phone call & it was Sajedur Rahman who picked the call. Then being convinced I decided to take him as my mentor.

On the journey I had lots of problems, queries & he was always with me to solve those cordially. I never faced any difficulties to follow the chart because those were very easy to prepare. I did not face any extra hair fall; moreover gained glowing skin.

I have some more steps to go & hope would be able to achieve my goal. Because I think I achieved some knowledge about healthy eating from this group.

I am grateful to Sajedur Rahman & thanks him a lot for creating such a platform. Thanks to Lose 2 Gain team for their dedication to give awareness & knowledge about nutrition.
