I'd been going to the gym for about 2 years, but I hadn't lost any weight. I was actually putting on weight due to my unhealthy food habit. I've been a size 10 to 12 all my life, but the weight's been creeping up over the last 5 years and I gained almost 21 kg. My last few jobs have been deskbound and my activity levels have gone down.

During the 12 weeks mentorship program, I lost 8.5 kg though I took another 12 weeks program with Sajedur Rahman bhaiya in 2020. I have lost a total of 17kg since August 2020.

I saw rapid results with this mentorship program. My experience has been great and been a blessing especially with Sajedur Rahman bhaiya as my mentor. It was hard for me to lose weight until now. Bhaiya was very helpful and thoughtful during this delicate time. My eating habits have changed, I have increased my exercise habits and feel more confidence in myself.
